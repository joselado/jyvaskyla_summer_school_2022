# Jyvaskyla Summer School 2022
Teaching material for the Jyväskylä summer school 2022 ["Emergent quantum matter in artificial two-dimensional materials"](https://www.jyu.fi/en/research/summer-and-winter-schools/jss/courses/basic-natural-phenomena)

## Interactive exercise sessions
The folder sessions contains the Jupyter notebooks for the different sessions of the course
- [Session 1: Introduction to 2D materials](https://github.com/joselado/jyvaskyla_summer_school_2022/blob/main/sessions/session1.ipynb)
- [Session 2: Superconductivity in 2D materials](https://github.com/joselado/jyvaskyla_summer_school_2022/blob/main/sessions/session2.ipynb)
- [Session 3: Magnetic 2D materials](https://github.com/joselado/jyvaskyla_summer_school_2022/blob/main/sessions/session3.ipynb)
- [Session 4: Moire electronic states and twisted van der Waals heterostructures](https://github.com/joselado/jyvaskyla_summer_school_2022/blob/main/sessions/session4.ipynb)
- [Session 5: Topological states in 2D materials](https://github.com/joselado/jyvaskyla_summer_school_2022/blob/main/sessions/session5.ipynb)

## Install
The Jupyter notebooks use [pyqula](https://github.com/joselado/pyqula), and can be installed from a terminal with pip as

```bash
pip install --upgrade pyqula
```

## Recordings of the lecture sessions
Each exercise session has an associated lecture session with the theory background. The recordings of the associated theory sessions can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgnB-4CcqRQnvTi7P0cUakQ).
